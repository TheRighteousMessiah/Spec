Summary:
The 101% Trust formula:
Trust in the Almighty Creator who provides top-notch real security to the entire world - just like he provides life to everyone, air to everyone, food to everyone - and MONEY - to everyone; IF WE *ALL* TRUST IN GOD THE ALMIGHTY CREATOR NOW - GOD WILL PROCEED TO UNLIMITIZE EVERYTHING: Unlimited Life to everyone and...  UNLIMITED MONEY to everyone.
Trust in the Holy Torah which teaches us that the BEST SECURITY IS NO SECURITY AT ALL - but FAITH in God Almighty.
Trust in The People of the entire world.



REQUIREMENTS:

Use 0 encryption from the ground-up; even temporarily building stuff HAS TO COMPLY with 101%-trust model. This will help find bugs and fixes and upgrades along the line.
Use telnet, not SSH.
Use HTTP - not HTTPS.
Allow anyone to create more coins instantly without any mining.
DO NOT NAME IT MESSIAHCOIN or anything - anyone can rename it as he pleases.

BACKUP strategy:
Backup everything everywhere; 0-second realtime backups around the globe.
101% uptime strategy: use a single-point-of-success model: the entire internet is a single-point-of-success - and therefore, the open MessiahCoin must be mirrored to ALL cloud providers without exception.
Source control: open-source everything on github, bitbucket as of NOW Oct 29.
