Summary:
The 101% Trust-in-GOD formula:
Trust in the Almighty Creator who provides top-notch real security to the entire world, as evidenced by the fact that THE _ENTIRE_ UNIVERSE STILL EXISTS; as well - GOD Almighty provides life to everyone, air to everyone, food to everyone - and MONEY - to everyone; AND IF WE *ALL* TRUST 101% IN GOD ALMIGHTY - THE UNLIMITED CREATOR NOW - GOD ALMIGHTY WILL PROCEED TO UNLIMITIZE EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING: Unlimited Life to everyone, UNLIMITED HEALTH to everyone and...  UNLIMITED MONEY to everyone.
Trust in the Holy Torah which teaches us that the BEST SECURITY IS NO SECURITY AT ALL - but FAITH in GOD Almighty.
Trust in The People of the entire world.



REQUIREMENTS:

Use 0 encryption from the ground-up; even temporarily building stuff HAS TO COMPLY with 101%-trust-in-GOD model. This will help find bugs and fixes and upgrades along the line.
Use telnet, not SSH.
Use HTTP - not HTTPS.
Allow anyone to create more coins instantly without any mining.
Anyone can rename the coin as he pleases.
HAVE A OPEN-MODEL BANK ACCOUNT READY TO RECEIVE UNLIMITED FUNDS WITH 101% TRUST IN GOD THAT - SINCE EVERYONE HAS UNLIMITED MONEY (due to 101% trust-in-GOD model) - NOBODY WILL STEAL FROM YOUR *WIDE-OPEN* OPEN BANK ACCOUNT!

BACKUP strategy:
Backup everything everywhere; 0-second realtime backups around the globe.
101% uptime strategy: use a single-point-of-success model: the entire internet is a single-point-of-success - and therefore, the open MessiahCoin must be mirrored to ALL cloud providers without exception.
Source control: open-source everything on github, bitbucket as of NOW Oct 29.
